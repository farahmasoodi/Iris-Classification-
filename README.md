# Iris-Classification-
This project demonstrates how to build a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Using the famous Iris dataset, the project walks through data exploration, visualization, model training, and evaluation.

# Project Highlights:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with graphical visualizations
- Feature selection and preprocessing
- Implementation of classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, KNN, etc.)
- Model evaluation with accuracy metrics and confusion matrix

# Tools & Libraries:
- Python

- Pandas & NumPy

- Matplotlib & Seaborn

- Scikit-learn
